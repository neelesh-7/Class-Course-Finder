# Course Explorer

This mini project involves importing course data from a JSON file, implementing filtering and sorting functionality on a webpage to help users explore different courses. The project aims to build a comprehensive user interface that allows for interactive data exploration, including filtering by course attributes and sorting course listings. This will give you practical experience in working with JSON data, JavaScript array methods, and DOM manipulation.
